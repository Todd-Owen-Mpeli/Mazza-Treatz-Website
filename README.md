# Mazza Treatz online store
This is a work-in-progress website I've built for a local corner shop in Swansea. It is constructed solely with HTML & SCSS - featuring a google maps API, Bootstrap 5 framework, and a custom Scroll Reveal AOS library.

# Project Context
Mazza Treats is a small shop selling sweats, snacks, and drinks from a variety of North American and East Asian background. Due to its recent establishment in 2020 it doesn't have an online presence and only offers an in-store experience.

Building a online website will provide Mazza treats customers the opportunity to see the vast products without the need to make the large investment of driving to the shops location.

# My Objective
To build an online website presence to display the large variety of unique products sold. Since these products are not available commonly within the UK, building an interactable e-commerce website to display these unique products will help ease customer uncertainty.

Alternatively to bring this corner store in-store only shopping experience into an online platform.     

# Lessons Learned
My first commercial E-commerce attempt, I really enjoyed the process of integrating a google maps API, while also styling the entire website elements. Specifically how to position images outside their div container, while also making each image responsive to different viewpoints.

I Enjoyed learning SASS extension for better CSS styling, file structure and creating specific reusable variables for better optimization. Also using Bootstrap 5 framework for better mobile responsiveness really improved my CSS hard-coding file reduction.

1. Git operations specifically init, add, status, commit, remote, push and pull. Additionally creating a remote repository to learn a better development workflow process.
2. SCSS File Structure, _font.scss, _color.scss_ etc. Creating seperate SCSS files for different attributes for better CSS opimazation.

# Personal Improvements
Although the website is fairly functional and provides the minimum viable product of displaying the large variety of unique products sold at the store, the current iteration of this project requires a list of improvements.

# Potential Future Features
1. Develop a database with the products information.
2. Develop a product availability feature (available or sold out). This will then be updated on the website in real time.
3. Re-building the entire website with React and Node.js
4. Implementing a checkout feature, this will allow users to have their items reserved for a selected period of time. and then be able to drive in-store for collection or pay a shipping fee.

# Deployment
