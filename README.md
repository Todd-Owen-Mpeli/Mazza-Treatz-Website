# Mazza Treatz Shop Site
This is a work-in-progress website I've built for a local corner shop in Swansea. It is constructed solely with HTML & SCSS - featuring a google maps API, Bootstrap 5 framework, and a custom Scroll Reveal AOS library.

# Project Context

Mazza Treats is a small shop selling sweats, snacks, and drinks from a variety of North American and East Asian background. Due to its recent establishment in 2020 it doesn't have an online presence and only offers an in-store experience.

My Objective
To build an online website presence to display the large variety of unique products sold. As these products are not available commonly within the UK. This will provide Mazza treats customers the opportunity to see the vast products without the need to drive to the shops location.

# Lessons Learned
My first commercial E-commerce attempt, I really enjoyed the process of integrating a google maps API, while also styling the entire website elements. Specifically how to position images outside their div container, while also making each image responsive to different viewpoints.

I Enjoyed learning SASS extension for better CSS styling, file structure and creating specific reusable variables for better optimization. Also using Bootstrap 5 framework for better mobile responsiveness really improved my CSS hard-coding file reduction.
